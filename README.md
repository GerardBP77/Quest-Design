Introduction
Quests are a huge part of most video games, there must be a development behind it that propels the player to experience a sense of immersion and creates a closer relationship with the game. Many necessary games take a negative approach to Quest Design, giving it less relevance than it should have at the time of its creation, which can carry out a flat product development, evolution factors.
Investing adequate time in innovating and fitting the missions within the dynamics of the video game, can make it a differentiating element and make our game a success, such as Oblivion, The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild or The Witcher 3.

On this page I will try to answer the following questions:
• What are missions?
• How to design missions in a professional way?
• What do they transmit?
• learning / tutorial
• Can they be boring?

Missions
"The missions are this place in a video game where game design, games, and technology come together." Jeszek Szczepanski - Building nonlinear narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn (GDC 2017).
A mission is a task for a player or a group of players that can be completed to obtain a reward if it is completed correctly, within terms established by the designer. In other words, the player must perform an action or set of actions that, when carried out correctly, will grant him a reward, whether in the form of an item, game resources or unlocking new options or paths, allowing him to advance in a better way in our game.
Depending on the type of reward and the value assigned by the designer within the game, we find two types of missions: the main missions and the secondary missions.
A primary mission is not simply an action that must be performed to progress through the game, and a secondary mission is not an optional task, which does not have a major effect on the core of the game. If the design of the missions is adequate, both the main and secondary missions will have an important weight within the game, helping the player to better understand the narrative, go through different plots in the story, level up, get improvements ... Things that ignoring these missions, it would not have been possible to obtain.
So how do we differentiate a primary mission from a secondary one?
A main mission generates a change in the plot of the narrative arc, creating a new journey, a new situation for the player, it becomes a turning point, with which, any task that is not directly related to the main plot of the History is not considered a primary mission.
Side quests help to better understand and describe in a deeper way the world that involves the character and the main plot, it reveals a deeper vision of the narrative arc, while obtaining experience and different types of rewards, generating a state of greater immersion in the game.


Designing missions
A mission must be able to be representative of these three points:
- It must be significant: the player needs a direct connection to the game, he needs to be fully involved in it. You will spend time of your life completing the task so whether it is a two minute or two hour mission, we cannot disappoint you. The player must have the feeling at all times that what he is doing is not insignificant. We must avoid at all costs that the task is boring and that it has no significance for the development of the game.

- It must be able to transmit: the feelings, the sensations, the thoughts that we want to provoke in the player while he performs the task that we have entrusted to him, must transcend the screen and enter his mind. The reasons that made a village what it is today, what happened among these children who fight for who can be a better hunter, why these monsters enter one territory and not another ... They broadly exemplify what can be going through the player's mind. This is information that we must add in a subtle way in our missions to provoke feelings and thoughts that go along the lines of the story we want to tell.

- Must be immersive: the player has a close connection to the game, enters it and participates directly in the action, is not reading or watching a movie. You must feel important while playing, we must create a sense of depth in the story, making you feel that the direction of the plot changes depending on the decisions you are making. If the mission does not give off the feeling of being part of the narrative, it will not be related to the characters and therefore not to the story, which will lead to a bad result in terms of mission design.

We must take perspective away from the game, what kind of game do we have, what kind of resources do we have? Can we do everything we want to do? Depending on the type of game being played, one type of resource or another will be used, a larger system or a more closed system can be used, puzzles or mini-games can be created, or perhaps only assassination missions are used.
If you have a clear quest crafting system, the team can afford to work easier and more coordinated. The process may be more expensive and lengthy for the development team, but missions will be more interesting and probably more fun to complete.
In order for our mission system to be dynamic enough to be fast and have all team members on the same line, allow for some freedom of design and interesting concepts at the same time, the entire team needs to be clear and understand the perfection the rules and concepts on which it will be based.
How do we start creating our mission system?
After a first brainstorm, all are written, then the team will filter and select them. Try to avoid "cliches" and try to direct the team's thoughts to more original areas. Write a couple of short sentences: what would be the concept of the mission, its objective, what should the player do to complete it ... But in a very general way. The concept must be simple, but the main ideas must be clear and express a concise idea that indicates that the mission may have potential.
In this way, little by little, a line of work will be created that will attract new ideas within the framework that we are generating and that will lay the foundations for our mission system. We will establish the relationships that may exist between them and we will link them with the main story and the world model in which our game unfolds.

Once the creation system to follow has been established, we will have to think about what kinds of situations are going to trigger each type of mission that we have established and what we are going to use them for. For example, Assassinate missions can be a good opportunity to introduce the player to a tutorial on how to fight or a cast mission, to show a main mechanic or part of the story.
If not used carefully, the game can become long and repetitive. The same applies to search missions and delivery missions. We must take into account at all times the type of content that may be more attractive to the player for each type of mission we design.

Important factors for the main missions
History is the main axis. The missions explain and express how the player evolves throughout the story and how that factor affects the entire course of the narrative arc.
The main plot factors should not be used as enemies to create a mission, we will use the main character to do it. We have to analyze what kinds of situations we will have to create for the hero to go to that place to defeat the monster and get an improvement, from there, we must relate the villain to the story, draw those points of interest, and introduce them in a way natural. That is why the villain is a powerful tool, and its proper use will lead to a more robust narrative, providing us with multiple options that we can use in future missions.
If we want to directly link the mission, without modifying the development of the story, we must create different paths that lead to our points of interest, so that the player perceives his decision as significant. We can use additional references to his choice of path later in the story, and even modifying the end of his game based on his choices will feel much more natural if it appears that he himself creates the path that the story follows. With that, we can avoid making several incredibly complex story development options, with several completely different branches, which can take a lot of time and resources that we may or may not have. It just has to look like it.

Important factors for side missions
The most important factor in these quests is the reward. A non-mandatory mission that provides elements or insights that do not affect the main plot of the game, at least must be clear and concise with what it offers. The player must always know what he is getting for that mission, this way, he will be able to assess if the effort is worth it.
If they are not specified, an unsigned agreement is created with the player, if the rewards are as expected, the player will be satisfied, but if the rewards do not match the complexity of the level, or their own expectations, not only will they not be You will have failed the player but you may feel cheated or disappointed and therefore we will have failed as designers.
Side quest creators: Not only the NPC can activate side quests, a note in a tree, a mark on the wall, a message under a rock ... keep in mind that you can create a side quest even if the player does not have that intention From the first moment.
A powerful tool to lean on to position these missions is the curiosity of the player, this can lead you to a mysterious hidden stage or to inspect some prominent element where the mission will be activated.
Players not only accept missions they're interested in, but we humans tend to give them a higher value when we owe it to the game rather than when we're choosing it. After a mission is presented to us, our brain will associate it with the source from which it comes, at that time it may hesitate to accept it, we must create our missions including attractive and interesting aspects that involve the player and the feelings that we have awakened in He through all the journey that takes in our game.
We must allow the player to think for himself, be it the solution, the way or the way to precede it. For example, we can create a situation where you have to decide between two people with different problems, who do I help? One will feel betrayed, but it will always add a touch of sentiment and belonging to that decision with which the player will feel more connected with the mission.
We must create a world that simulates life and tells the story. In the Spore RPG, start with two different options, be it eating meat or eating plants, you start as an amoeba that continues to evolve. When he comes out of the water, his legs grow, you have the option to kill an entire clan or make them your allies, if you choose to kill them, some of the clans will beg for their lives at some point or start to escape, at this point they realize that you don't have to kill them to get the upgrades, you can befriend them and get the same result.
Establishing these types of links between our characters and the main character is the main objective that we should aim for, because it results in a rewarding and / or unexpected experience that you learn through our game.

Timing. We must always take into account the moment in history when we are to activate or not a secondary mission. If you are about to kill Zeus with all the elements you have gathered throughout the game, you have faced and killed all the gods that have got in your way to the final boss, but before the final fight, when you are About to feel the wrath of the god killing your family, you don't want a random NPC asking you to pick up some medicine for his wife. Truth?
Always remember the words of the legendary Professor Oak.

Pacing
Now let's talk about the rhythm. How and in what way we want to transmit certain feelings is important, but knowing when to do it is the key to controlling the “tempo” of our game. One of the most powerful tools to control it is the rhythm graph. This tool is also used in narrative design and level design.

Tension
Humans tend to remember the moments with the least tension and those that have it the most, therefore, they leave spaces of time that stop and change the rhythm of the game so that the spectator or in our case the player rests.
For example, in Skyrim, you start and the first thing you see is a carriage with people you don't know in a place you don't know either, but everything remains calm, you feel like a new adventure is about to begin. People remember that scene because it has no tension and allows them to observe and reflect on their surroundings and what awaits them.
Later, after learning about its history, some basic mechanics, and training the dragon, you don't expect to suddenly fight one. The stage changes, the camera moves faster, the music is more dramatic and creates a situation where you have to hurry up and kill the dragon with all your resources. All this leads the player towards the climax, the tension, where the dragon is killed. Once the match is over, the tension disappears again and the player is allowed to relax and rest again.
We don't recall every stage of the game or the entire story, but the developers made sure to take the most important elements of their story into account and highlight them between pauses and rhythm changes.
Tension can be a very important aspect in the design of our missions. But you have to know how to manage it and raise your grade at the right time.

For this, we have two types of mechanisms:
• Short missions: if the player can play the mission in a single session, the problem is solved since the game will start and end in the same race.
• Hooking them up, the mission can be so good that the player will want to keep playing until it is complete, this will make them not leave until it is finished or until they reach a low voltage point. This creates a situation where you won't miss a beat and will be at a point where it doesn't impact the previously created tension, so it won't go bankrupt the next time you play.

Pace
In order to properly manage the moments of rest, we need to create a series of events that will occur during our history, we will create a step by step rhythm graph.

Then we create a graph that expresses and shows all the tension throughout the story. So, we position our events in the time they will appear.

Now that we have the rhythm graph created for our story, the next step is to give each sequence type a different type of color, assigning each type a different mechanic, such as combat, scene, or journey sequences. If we categorize and analyze each situation in the narrative arc, the events will not be perceived as separate elements if, for example, the travel action or any other action is interspersed with other categories of actions, such as combat or cinematic.

MAIN QUEST CREATION
Let's make an example of a mission creation: the main protagonist of the story is traveling around the country and discovers that his town was attacked 2 days ago, we started with little tension and when the character arrives in the city, the tension increases.
He discovers that his wife and daughter were hiding under the house, the tension decreases when the wife begins to explain what happened.
The wife mentions that the attacker was a longtime friend of hers and that he became evil after a sorcerer possessed his soul. The possessed friend returns to the village to end the lives of the heroes and ends up killing his wife, the tension increases.
The "villain" leaves the town, the daughter and the hero begin to talk about their revenge, the tension decreases. The hero discovers how to break possession and save his friend, the tension increases again, the hero chases him and finds him, a fight will begin and the tension continues to rise, he destroys the spell, the tension decreases when they talk about how sorry he is and how the witcher possessed it.
The daughter joins them on their journey to kill the warlock and discovers that he has a special inner power, the tension increases again. They meet the sorcerer and the daughter unleashes his power, defeats the sorcerer and with it decreases the tension.
They finally return home to create a new path in their lives.
The roller coaster of emotions will keep the player hooked, as the changes of pace appear exponentially in the story: when the friend returns to normal, when the daughter unleashes power and when she beats the witcher, these are the turning points where we want to emotionally catch the player and make him want to keep playing.

SIDE QUEST CREATION
New example: Our game is an RTS. The game is designed around resource management and tactical combat, having the player build a base and defend it.
From this moment on, the player is free to build his base however he wants with the resources he has, to defend himself against incoming enemies.
When this section of the game begins, the player will be told that a certain number of units, around 40, will be required to complete the map, making this our second and final main objective during the Basic Defense Part of the game.
In this way, a secondary mission is generated by the obligation of history: exploration. It is primarily defined by the player who sends units into the unknown to find scattered resources and rewards through different routes to the end goal, in order to reward dynamic playstyle.
It is mainly based on two factors. Secondary search prompts via minimap and player action. Although scouting independently might be an option, the player has to risk sending units off base with the risk of not finding profits at the end of the road.
The side quests given to the player are based on his leaving his comfort zone. We have two different types of side quests, and both will be notified to the player with a popup.
Rescue missions: based on the rescue of allied units stranded in a certain location on the map. Once the player reaches that location, the stranded units will become part of the allied army.
Resource Gathering Missions - These missions will be based on marking a general area on the map where a repository is found for certain types of resources needed to progress through the game.
Both types of side quests are based on providing the player with vague information about locations (marking a general area on the map) and allowing them to make the decision about whether or not they should complete them.
Our goal in adding these scattered secondary goals is to add more dynamism and freedom to the game, breaking the typical RTS scheme, while offering some form of profit (be it units or resources) by taking a risk.
